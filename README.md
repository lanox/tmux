TODO: Write a project description

## Installation

Script is written in Python3. So you may need to setup pyenv or get python3 from Homebrew.

iTerm2 Specific.

1) Clone this repository.
2) Preferences -> Profiles -> General
    Under Command Section:
      Send test at start: Add tmux.py

This will start tmux.py everytime you open new window.

## Usage

If you have got steps above right, every time you open new iTerminal you should either be reconnected to a disconnected session, or new session will be created with random session name.

## Contributing

Happy for any contribution to be send.

## History

If Docker can generate random names every time it creates container so can tmux.
